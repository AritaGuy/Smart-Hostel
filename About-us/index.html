                    <p> In Moringa school smart hostel helps student who can't access the phyiscal school programm and
                        it ensures proper studies which require a good environment where our concentration does not
                        interrupt. In Moringa school hostel program,
                        promises us to provide that kind of environment. Therefore, parents leave their children in
                        hostels to study. The experience of living in a hostel is far different from the experience of
                        living at home.

                        In a hostel, the day is properly planned. Due to discipline and timetables, students become
                        civilized. In a hostel, a warden looks after all the students and makes sure that everything is
                        alright. Despite a lot of restrictions, students find opportunities to enjoy their life.
